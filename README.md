# **Medical Dataset Analysis: Python, SQL, and Insight**
---
## **Overview**

The mission of this project is to analyze and derive actionable insights from healthcare data by integrating Python-based data cleaning with SQL-driven analysis. Using hospitalization details, medical examinations, and patient information, the project aims to ensure high-quality data and extract meaningful patterns that support informed healthcare decision-making and efficient resource optimization. It is structured into two key modules, beginning with comprehensive data cleaning to ensure accuracy, consistency, and proper structure. With a high-quality dataset in place, the second module leverages SQL queries to uncover meaningful insights. This work represents more than a technical exercise, it is a transformative journey into the practical application of medical dataset analysis.
