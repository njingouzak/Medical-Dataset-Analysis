# **Medical Dataset Analysis: Python, SQL, and Insight**
---
## **Overview**

The mission of this project is to analyze and derive actionable insights from healthcare data by integrating Python-based data cleaning with SQL-driven analysis. Using hospitalization details, medical examinations, and patient information, the project aims to ensure high-quality data and extract meaningful patterns that support informed healthcare decision-making and efficient resource optimization. It is structured into two key modules, beginning with comprehensive data cleaning to ensure accuracy, consistency, and proper structure. With a high-quality dataset in place, the second module leverages SQL queries to uncover meaningful insights. This work represents more than a technical exercise, it is a transformative journey into the practical application of medical dataset analysis.

## **Project Workflow**

1- **Data Processing and Cleaning for Hospilization Details Data**
2- **Data Processing and Cleaning for Medical Examination Data**
3- **Average Hospital Charges Analysis**
4- **High Charges Analysis:** Extract unique customer identifiers, corresponding years, and hospital charges specifically targeting records where charges exceed 700.
5- **High BMI Patients Analysis:** Extract the names, years, and hospital charges of patients with a Body Mass Index (BMI) greater than 35.
6- **Customers with major surgeries:**  Identify customer IDs and names of individuals who have undergone major surgical procedures.
7- **Average Charges per Hospital Tier in 2000**
8- **Smoking Patients with Transplants Analysis:** Retrieve customer IDs, BMI, and hospital charges for patients who are smokers and have undergone a transplant.
9- **Patients with Major Surgeries or Cancer History:** Retrieve the names of customers who have either undergone at least two major surgeries or have a documented history of cancer.
10- **Customer with Most Major Surgeries:** Identify and display the customer with the highest number of major surgeries.
11- **Customers with Major Surgeries and City Tiers:** Compile a list of customers who have undergone major surgeries along with the tier levels of their respective cities (city_tier).
12- **Average BMI by City Tier in 1995**
13- **High BMI Customers with Health Issues:** Extract customer IDs, names, and hospital charges for individuals who have documented health issues and a Body Mass Index (BMI) greater than 30.
14- **Customers with Highest Charges and City Tier by Year:** identify the customer with the highest total hospital charges for each year and display their corresponding city_tier.
15- **Top 3 Customers with Highest Average Yearly Charges:** Identifying the top 3 customers with the highest average yearly hospital charges over the years they have been hospitalized.
16- **Ranking Customers by Total Charges:** Ranks customers by their total hospitalization charges over the years in descending order.
17- **Identifying Peak Year for Hospitalizations:** Determine the year with the highest number of hospitalizations.

## **Key Outcomes**

- Average hospital charges for all records was **$13,564.6**
- Medical conditions and surgeries were  associated High hospital charges
- Hospital charges have shown certain variation depending on hospital tier and city tier
- BMI and smoking are related to the increased of healthcare costs
